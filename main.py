# State diagram
# Draw suggested moves using draw_hex(Pieces inside the board) --> DONE
# Draw suggested placements using draw_hex(Pieces outside the board)
# Implement sliding algorithm

# Implement immbolized
# Implement AI vs player
# Implement AI vs AI
# Probably will make board list of stacks to take beetle into consideration
